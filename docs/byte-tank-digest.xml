<h3><a href="https://lopespm.com/notes/2025/09/16/why_is_my_kitchen_so_clean.html">Why is my kitchen so clean?</a></h3>
<div><p>If you had a video call with me, if you happened to see my videos, or if you visited my flat, odds are that a question came up to your mind. The same question that I’ve been asked at least 8 times (and counting) over these past years: <em>“How do you keep your kitchen so clean?”</em> With a possible follow up of <em>“Do you even cook?”</em> or <em>“Have you just moved in?”</em>, amongst others.</p>

         </center>

<p><br /></p>

<p>I’m of the opinion that once you get asked multiple times the same question, then it’s time to document it and have it available for the next person.</p>

<p>It’s time to address it.</p>

<h2 id="behind-the-scenes">Behind the scenes</h2>

<p>This is how my kitchen stand looks on an average work day. I didn’t prop it up for the picture.</p>

<div class="image-mosaic">
  <div class="image-mosaic-card image-mosaic-card-tall image-mosaic-card-wide"></div>
</div>

<p>In case you are wondering, the container in the center is soaking buckwheat groats, which after a day of soaking I grind, mix condiments and sometimes small vegetables, put in the oven, resulting in a delicious loaf of buckwheat bread that I use as a replacement for bread. I highly recommend it.</p>

<div class="image-mosaic">

<p>That should answer the question that yes, I do cook.</p>

<h2 id="why">Why</h2>

<p>There are 3 reasons why my kitchen looks virtually the same, every time.</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>I like to have my environment organized and free of clutter and distractions.</strong> I’ve had a long, conscious effort to reduce clutter and inconsequential distractions from my life, stemming from an experience that I might write about in a later day. 
    <ul>
      <li>The positive ramifications of consistently living and being surrounded by an environment and stimulus of objects that really matter, are more than I could ever describe in words.</li>
      <li>It’s a small present for my future self: when I cook, do something in the kitchen, or at home, I have a deeply ingrained habit of sorting and cleaning everything out before moving to the next thing. That way, my <em>full energy</em> can be allocated and focused towards a single place.</li>
      <li>This goes beyond the physical realm. On both my personal and work laptop it is rare to have more than 3 browser windows open, each one often having less than 10 tabs. Whenever those numbers temporarily increase, I document their state, close them down, and arrive at a clean state again. Essentially using <a href="https://lopespm.com/notes/2023/05/18/solving-task-switching-through-documentation.html">documentation as a checkpoint mechanism</a></li>
      <li>There are other examples of this. In case you follow <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@TechIngredients">Tech ingredients</a>, you’ll notice that their laboratory and space is quite neat, regardless of the outstanding breadth of experiments done in the channel. I found it amusing that some years ago they were once asked by some viewers <em>“how do they keep their lab so clean”</em>, to which the main presenter replied that “we are not hiding anything, we just take care to tidy and store the components we are not working on” (paraphrased).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>The rest of the utensils are away from camera sight.</strong> When I am having a meeting or sharing my thoughts via video, I want to get things done and not have my mind occupied with non-consequential thoughts such as <em>“Oh, my background looks a bit a messy. That piece looks out place. I wonder how that looks for someone else”</em>, nor do I want to distract my interlocutors with something irrelevant in the background. There are video filters which blur out the background, but I don’t like the way they look, not do I want to have yet another moving component in my workflow that might (or might not) work. If my background is relatively the same and neutral, then I don’t have to worry about it, and can focus my energies on the the things that <em>really matter</em>.</li>
  <li>Apart from my weekly buckwheat bread, <strong>I only cook at weekends</strong>, since I am fortunate enough to often cook for pleasure, rather than necessity. The rest of the week I either get to have my meals at the office, or through <a href="https://planty.uk/">Planty</a>, a plant based clean food subscription.</li>

<h2 id="dangers-of-over-consumption">Dangers of over-consumption</h2>

<p>One’s life can very easily be wasted away on non-consequential, “time passing”, filler, short-term hedonistic experiences. </p>

<p>It’s a blessing to enjoy life’s little pleasures, but it’s perilous to lead a life consisting of only discrete pleasures and experiences that are not, or cannot be chained together in any way shape or form. Essentially, a life spent as a passive spectator through and through, observing the years scroll by.</p>

<p>That feels like an egregious squandering of the most precious gift we’ve been given: life. Chaining experiences together and compounding them into a product that amounts to much more than the sum of its parts is one of the most intriguing, addicting, but most of all, rewarding parts of life.</p>

<!--more-->

<h2 id="benefits-of-production">Benefits of production</h2>

<p>Building up years of study to land to land a job that takes one out of poverty, raising a child into a full grown adult, building relationships consciously into heartwarming friendships or a loving family, writing a book or article that not only helps oneself but also many others, building a successful company based on years of networking and experiences.</p>

<p>They require considerable amounts of deliberate actions where different experiences are aggregated, chained and combined in novel ways that add value to a system. Value is produced. </p>

<p>Best of all, society rewards you for that! If something you produced is deemed to be of value and (directly or indirectly) consumed by a fellow human being, you can get compensated in currency, recognition, access, friendship, amongst others. As the products of your labor expand and compound, an even more interesting non-trivial effect starts to happen that could not have been predicted in the first place. Personally, both articles and a presentation I did resulted in interesting job offers that I didn’t plan for, nor could I have predicted.</p>

<h2 id="but-its-not-easy">But it’s not easy</h2>

<p>Discipline, self reflection and the hard work to plan and aggregate different actions and experiences, are the most important ingredients to consistently produce value. </p>

<p>If this would be easy, everyone would be doing it by default. That’s why self help books are such a profitable business. This difficulty stems from our inherited hardwired behaviours that optimize towards immediate gratification, which served our late ancestors to such success that these traits got selected and filtered through the ages as an <a href="https://lopespm.com/notes/2025/02/10/story-human-body-lessons.html">essential part of our species</a>.</p>

<p>However, in the context of our modern societies where resources and entertainment are abundant, these traits backfire and when left to their own devices, can easily stray one into a life of misery and value bankruptcy<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>.</p>

<h2 id="the-antidote-self-discipline-workout">The antidote. Self-discipline workout.</h2>

<p>Just like any other muscle in our body, self-discipline requires consistent and intentional work to stay strong, but relying solely on will power, a scarce and fleeting resource, is often not enough. In order to protect this precious resource, one can set up an environment to block out frivolous distractions and non-consequential instant gratifications. In my case, I don’t have video streaming subscriptions (since I’ve come to realise that most series and movies add little to no value to my life), I have blocked distracting websites and videogames on my computer and expelled junk and sugary foods from home<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Remember, <strong>any time spent in over-indulging consumption, is time not spent producing value</strong>.</p>

<p>Instead, create the habit of self reflection and journalling, organize events (at work, with your friends or loved ones), write articles and publish videos that can be seen and judged by others (like this article), welcome accountability and reposability, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBR5v89L6gk">clean your room</a>. These actions are very likely accessible to you now, at (close to) zero cost. <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">3</a></sup></p>

<p>Replace non-consequential consumption with fruitful production. Start anywhere, start now.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<div class="footnotes">
  <ol>
    <li id="fn:1">
      <p>Drug abuse, over-eating, alcohol abuse, gambling, over-indulging, instantaneous and inconsequential sexual gratification are some examples of how one’s life could be filled with perceived pleasures that when summed together amount to close to nothing.<a href="#fnref:1" rel="reference">&#8617;</a></p>
    </li>
    <li id="fn:3">
      <p>This is done via the <a href="https://getcoldturkey.com/">Cold Turkey app</a>, a mac app that I fully recommend, where a long phrase needs to be written before I can unlock these features, which helps me give pause and stop from mindless content consumption. <a href="#fnref:3" rel="reference">&#8617;</a></p>
    </li>
    <li id="fn:2">
      <p>Extremes touch. Leading a life or pure restrictions where there is no space for exploration of new experiences that at the time don’t serve a higher purpose is not advisable, since there will be no raw material to draw from when producing. But given that it is much harder to go from pure consumption to a healthy balance rather than from a pure production starting point, it is best to target over-producing and then re-balance.<a href="#fnref:2" rel="reference">&#8617;</a></p>

<h3><a href="https://lopespm.com/notes/2025/07/20/napoleon-biography.html">Napoleon Biography: Takeaways</a></h3>
<div><p>I’ve recently finished reading <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Story-Human-Body-Evolution-Disease/dp/030774180X">Napoleon: A Life</a>, a well researched book by Andrew Roberts about the full and well travelled life of Napoleon Bonaparte, his rises and falls, and glimpses of what made the famous soldier-statesman tick. These are my main takeaways:</p>

  <li>“A general’s principle talent consists in knowing the mentality of the soldier and in winning his confidence.

<h3><a href="https://lopespm.com/hardware/2025/07/15/arduino.html">Inside the Box: Everything I did with an Arduino Starter Kit</a></h3>
<div><p>Earlier this year I saw a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IrocytwdeEY">Tech Ingredients episode</a> where a laser gimbal automatically tracks drones and shoots them down. I was fascinated by their motion control mechanism, specially the usage of a PI Controller, a high-frequency clock <a href="https://www.pjrc.com/store/teensy40.html">Teensy microcontroller</a>, and their integration with custom hardware and a machine vision powered tracker.</p>

<p>Soon after I was researching the underlying electronics and how to experiment upon their concepts. The most obvious microcontroller to drive these would be an Arduino, but several recommendations pointed towards acquiring a kit rather than a single microcontroller, and the <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/ELEGOO-Complete-Ultimate-c...</div>
