<h3><a href="https://stephango.com/saw">Use the saw, fear the saw</a></h3>
<div><p>When I learned to use a table saw, my teacher impressed upon me that the machine wants to cut fingers. Fear the saw!</p>

<p>Powerful tools can do powerful things. If you want to make handmade wooden furniture you must cut wood. Your desire to have limbs and your desire to have furniture are not at odds if you learn to use tools safely.</p>

<p>There <em>are</em> table saws that will stop at the touch of a finger, but I don’t know of any chainsaw that won’t cut an arm. There is a limit to how safe a tool can be before its function is crippled.</p>

<p>We should not stop making powerful tools because they are dangerous. Rather, we should empower people to use powerful tools safely.</p>

<p>I use the saw, I fear the saw. I have handmade furniture, and I have all my limbs.</p></div>

<h3><a href="https://stephango.com/ramblings">If you're remote, ramble</a></h3>
<div><p>A tip for remote teams of 2-10 people. Create a personal “ramblings” channel for each teammate in your team’s chat app of choice.</p>

<p>Ramblings channels let everyone share what’s on their mind without cluttering group channels. Think of them as personal journals or microblogs inside your team’s chat app, a lightweight way to add ambient social cohesion.</p>

<p>People typically post short updates 1-3 times per week. Common topics include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>ideas related to current projects</li>
  <li>musings about blog posts, articles, user feedback</li>
  <li>“what if” suggestions</li>
  <li>photos from recent trips or hobbies</li>
  <li>rubber ducking a problem</li>
</ul>

<p>Each ramblings channel should be named after the team member, and only that person can post top-level messages. Others can reply in threads, but not start new ones.</p>

<p>All the ramblings channels should be in a <em>Ramblings</em> section at the bottom of the channel list. They should be muted by default, with no expectation that anyone else will read them.</p>

<p>We started experimenting with ramblings at <a class="internal-link" href="/obsidian">Obsidian</a> two years ago, and they’ve been surprisingly sticky. We have no scheduled meetings, so ramblings are our equivalent of water cooler talk. We want as much deep focus time as possible, so ramblings help us stay connected while minimizing interruptions.</p>

<p>Because they are so free and loose, some of our best ideas emerge from ramblings. They’re often the source of feature ideas, small prototypes, and creative solutions to long-standing problems.</p>

<p>About once a year, we do a week-long in-person meetup. Ramblings have been one successful way we keep the human connection going throughout the rest of the year.</p></div>

<h3><a href="https://stephango.com/vault">How I use Obsidian</a></h3>
<div><p>I use <a class="internal-link" href="/obsidian">Obsidian</a> to think, take notes, write essays, and publish this site. This is my bottom-up approach to note-taking and organizing things I am interested in. It embraces chaos and laziness to create emergent structure.</p>

<p>In Obsidian, a “vault” is simply a folder of files. This is important because it adheres to my <a class="internal-link" href="/file-over-app">file over app</a> philosophy. If you want to create digital artifacts that last, they must be files you can control, in formats that are easy to retrieve and read. Obsidian gives you that freedom.</p>

<p>The following is in no way dogmatic, just one example of how you can use Obsidian. Take the parts you like.</p>
