该文章汇总了美国主要信用卡发行商的pre-qualified（预合格）查询方式，包括American Express、Bank of America、Chase、Citibank等机构的查询链接和操作步骤。文章提醒，预合格不等于最终获批，银行会进行hard pull（硬查询）。同时提供了直达链接和从官网进入的指引，方便用户查看自己可能符合资格的信用卡产品。 <div>

<p>Update 5/6/25: Chase is back (update: not working again)</p>
<p>Most credit card issuers now allow you to view cards that you&#8217;ve been pre-approved for online. Here is a full list of issuers that do allow this, along with the relevant websites/contact information.</p>

<title>[Confirmed] Hilton To Launch New Highest Loyalty Tier ‘Diamond Reserve’</title>
<link>https://www.doctorofcredit.com/rumor-hilton-to-launch-new-highest-loyalty-tier-diamond-reserve/</link>
<guid>https://www.doctorofcredit.com/rumor-hilton-to-launch-new-highest-loyalty-tier-diamond-reserve/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> 
希尔顿推出新"Diamond Reserve"忠诚度等级，需年消费$18,000和80晚住宿，每消费$1获22积分。现有等级要求将降30%：Silver需7晚/3次/17,500分(原10晚/4次/25,000分)；Gold需28晚/14次/52,500分(原40晚/20次/75,000分)；Diamond需42晚/21次/84,000分(原60晚/30次/120,000分)。新增120晚里程碑奖励，可选30,000积分或确认性升级。 <div>
<p>Update 11/18/25: <a href="https://www.hilton.com/en/p/hilton-honors/tier-updates/">This has now been officially announced</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.uscreditcardguide.com/leaked-new-hilton-diamond-reserve-tier-coming-in-2026/">US Credit Card Guide</a> was able to find a leak of a new Hilton loyalty tier called &#8216;Diamond Reserve&#8217; this will be a step above Diamond. Here is what we know so far:</p>
<ul>
<li>Requires $18,000 in spend and 80 nights stayed</li>
<li>Earns 22x points per $1 spent (10 base and 12 from Diamond Reserve). Diamond currently earns 10 base and 10 from Diamond</li>
<li>Existing tiers will have requirements <strong>reduced</strong> by 30%
<ul>
<li>Hilton Honors Silver status will require seven nights, three stays, or 17,500 points (compared to 10 nights, four stays, or 25,000 points)</li>
<li>Hilton Honors Gold status will require 28 nights, 14 stays, or 52,500 points (compared to 40 nights, 20 stays, or 75,000 points)</li>
<li>Hilton Honors Diamond status will require 42 nights, 21 stays, or 84,000 points (compared to 60 nights, 30 stays, or 120,000 points)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>New milestone rewards at 120 nights, choose between 30,000 points and confirmable room upgrade</li>
</ul>
<h2>Our Verdict</h2>
<p>Major change for most readers would be the reduced requirements I think. Will be interesting to see what other benefits are offered from Hilton.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Charles Schwab Up To $500 Bonus</h3>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><a href="https://www.schwab.com/public/schwab/nn/refer-prospect.html">Direct link to bonus</a></p>
<p>This is now a soft pull making it much more interesting. People like this account because the account is quite useful (e.g ATM fees reimbursed, no fees for foreign transaction withdrawals) and you can also get this account and a brokerage account at the same time for one hard pull. The brokerage account then gives you access to the <a href="https://www.doctorofcredit.com/two-new-american-express-charles-schwab-cards-available-sign-ups-eligibility-requirements/">Charles Schwab credit cards</a>. Obviously not for everybody, but a pretty good combination.</p>

<title>My Approval on Chase Sapphire Reserve for Business Card</title>
<link>https://www.doctorofcredit.com/my-approval-on-chase-sapphire-reserve-for-business-card/</link>
<guid>https://www.doctorofcredit.com/my-approval-on-chase-sapphire-reserve-for-business-card/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> 
新Chase Sapphire Reserve for Business卡持有者分享申请体验。该卡有$30,000消费要求，$795年费，提供$300旅行抵用金。作者曾于2025年5月申请INK Unlimited卡，现在(11月)符合6个月间隔建议。大额税款支付可帮助满足消费要求，且卡提供6个月完成消费的期限。申请最初挂起，但两天后自动批准。现在需消费$30,000满足要求。 <div>
<p>I&#8217;m a proud new Chase Sapphire Reserve for Business cardholder!</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.doctorofcredit.com/brand-new-chase-sapphire-reserve-for-business-card/">200,000 points signup bonus</a> is excellent, albeit with a hefty $30,000 spend requirement. For me the $300 Travel Credit is good as cash, and hopefully that can be done twice during the first cardmember year which mostly offsets the $795 annual fee.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been trying to avoid hitting 5/24 and so have been focusing on business card applications. The standard advise going around is to apply for Chase business cards once every 6 months. My prior Chase business card was an INK Unlimited in early May 2025, and it&#8217;s now mid-November 2025, so that should be enough.</p>
<p>I also had a good feeling about applying now since it was crunch time for Chase INK applications with<a href="https://www.doctorofcredit.com/chase-ink-cash-ink-unlimited-900-90000-points-signup-bonus/"> the 90k offer ending.</a> I hoped that with the influx of applications, approvals might somehow come easier. Who knows.</p>
<p>I decided to go for the Sapphire Reserve for Business card due to a few large tax bills (federal, state, property) which can cover a good chunk of the $30,000 spend requirement. The card gives 6 months for meeting the spend requirement which makes it easier to manage.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I used a referral link to apply for the card, and the card application went pending. Just two days later it was approved automatically without having to call in. Yay!</p>
<p>Now off to spend $30,000&#8230;</p>

<h2>Avoiding Fees</h2>
<h3>Monthly Fees</h3>
<p>First class checking account has no monthly fees to worry about.</p>
<h3><span id="Early_Account_Termination_Fee">Early Account Termination Fee</span></h3>
<p>I wasn’t able to find an early account termination in the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.wingsfinancial.com/schedule-of-fees">fee schedule</a></p>
<h2><span id="Referral_Bonus">Referral Bonus</span></h2>
<p>There is also a $50 referral bonus for both parties. Last time Wings Financial offered a bonus the referral bonus and the main bonus stacked. Do not share your referrals in the comments below, you can share them in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.doctorofcredit.com/share-your-wings-credit-union-referral-here/">this linked posted instead</a>.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.doctorofcredit.com/wings-financial-credit-union-300-checking-bonus/#comment-1614978">Some discussion on linking the promotions here</a>.</p>
<h2>Our Verdict</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.doctorofcredit.com/wings-credit-union-400-checking-bonus-200-savings-bonus/">Not as good as the previous $400 bonus</a>.

<title>Rakuten: Get 10%/10x Back on Stubhub</title>
<link>https://www.doctorofcredit.com/rakuten-get-10-10x-back-on-stubhub/</link>
<guid>https://www.doctorofcredit.com/rakuten-get-10-10x-back-on-stubhub/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> 
Rakuten今日(11/18/25)提供Stubhub的10%/10x返利活动。很多人利用此机会使用Chase Sapphire Reserve的$150年费后半额度。即使不用Stubhub，购买其他商品也能赚取10%利润+信用卡积分，Rakuten将持续发布10x或更高返利活动。 <div>
<h2>The Offer</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.rakuten.com/shop/stubhub?">Direct Link to Rakuten</a> | <a href="https://www.cashbackmonitor.com/cashback-store/stubhub/">Check all portal rates</a></p>
<ul>
<li>Rakuten is offering 10%/10x back on Stubhub today, 11/18/25. Unclear how long it will last.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Our Verdict</h2>
<p>A lot of people want this to use up their $150 Chase Sapphire Reserve credit for the second half of the year. Rakuten occasionally goes up to 10x. We&#8217;ll try to repost this whenever Rakuten or another portal gets to 10x or higher.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you literally have no use for Stubhub, you might want to buy something at portal promo like this one to net the 10% profit + points on the credit card. It&#8217;s not much, but maybe worth the hassle.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re new to Rakuten,<a href="https://www.doctorofcredit.com/rakuten-50-5000-referral-bonus-highest-ever/"> it&#8217;s a good time to sign up now with the $50/5,000 points signup bonus.</a></p>

<title>[YMMV] PayPal: 20% Cashback When You Pay In 4</title>

<guid>https://www.doctorofcredit.com/targeted-paypal-20-cashback-when-you-pay-in-4/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> 
PayPal向部分用户推出20%现金返现活动，使用Pay in 4付款方式可享，单笔交易上限1250美元，活动截止至2025年12月8日。作者预计该优惠额度将很快用完。 <div>
<h2><span id="The_Offer">The Offer</span></h2>
<ul>
<li>PayPal is offering some account holders 20% cashback when you pay in 4 (limit of $1,250 in spend per transaction). Valid until 12/8/25</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.doctorofcredit.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/13034607-C3A9-4E85-91E8-E2F2D4DBBC53.png"><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-247553" height="598" src="https://www.doctorofcredit.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/13034607-C3A9-4E85-91E8-E2F2D4DBBC53.png" width="507" /></a></p>
<h2>Our Verdict</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.doctorofcredit.com/targeted-paypal-5-cashback-when-you-pay-in-4-limit-250-back/">Offer reverts to the old 5% back deal on 12/9</a>. Suspect this will hit the cap quickly.</p>

<title>Get $150 From Rakuten/TCB With Kraken Crypto Signup (Stack With Up To $150 via Referral)</title>
<link>https://www.doctorofcredit.com/get-100-10000-from-rakuten-or-topcashback-with-kraken-signup-stack-with-referral-bonus/</link>
<guid>https://www.doctorofcredit.com/get-100-10000-from-rakuten-or-topcashback-with-kraken-signup-stack-with-referral-bonus/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> 
文章介绍了Kraken加密货币交易平台的多重奖励方案：通过Rakuten购物门户可获$150/15,000点奖励，Kraken推荐计划提供$75+$75奖励。需在30天内完成指定加密货币交易（如$260买入立即$255卖出可满足要求）。提醒读者加密交易有风险，可能亏损，且推荐奖金不适用于美国部分州。建议新手选择简单交易方式，并提到可利用"Spin to win"获得额外$20-$30奖励。 <div>
<p><strong>Update 11/17/25</strong>: <a href="https://www.topcashback.com/kraken/">Topcashback</a> is at $152.51 now, so that&#8217;s another option. <a href="https://www.rakuten.com/shop/kraken?">Rakuten</a> is also still at $150/15,000. Some people have complained about Topcashback tracking so maybe it makes more sense to do the Rakuten. (Personally I used Topcashback a while back. It tracked and paid out fine for me, and it stacked with the referral as well.)</p>
<p><a href="https://www.doctorofcredit.com/share-your-current-kraken-codes-here-up-to-150/">You can find a referral in this post</a> &#8211; comments there are closed to new commenting. Do not leave a referral in the comments below and no referral fishing.</p>
<p><strong>Update 11/15/25</strong>: <a href="https://www.rakuten.com/shop/kraken?">Rakuten</a> now $150 again.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>The Offer</h2>
<p>Note: Kraken is a crypto app and is not FDIC/SPIC insured. Do what you&#8217;re comfortable with.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.rakuten.com/shop/kraken?">Rakuten</a> is offering $150 (or 15,000 points) when you signup for Kraken and trade $200.</li>
<li><del>Topcashback is offering $100 when you signup for Kraken and trade $100.&nbsp;</del></li>
<li><del><a href="https://www.doctorofcredit.com/ymmv-capital-one-shopping-kraken-220-bonus-75-referral/">We&#8217;re hearing multiple reports out there that the $220 offer from Capital One is around again</a> <span style="font-size: 10pt;">(you&#8217;ll have to poke around a lot to get this and possibly still won&#8217;t get it). Update: the $220 is very widespread,<a href="https://www.doctorofcredit.com/exploring-increased-offers-with-the-capital-one-shopping-portal/"> just poke around in Capital One and do some click, etc.&nbsp;</a></span></del></li>
</ul>
<p>Separately, <a href="https://www.kraken.com/referrals">there is a referral bonus of up to $150</a> for referrer and $150 for the new member when the new members signs up and trades crypto, like Bitcoin <em>(stablecoin does not work for the referral bonus)</em>. You can signup on the web or in the mobile app, but do the crypto trading in the Kraken app. Don&#8217;t forget to input the code during the signup process. Bonus details:</p>
<ul>
<li>Trade $100 and get $15</li>
<li>Trade $300 and get $20 ($35 total)</li>
<li>Trade $500 and get $40 ($75 total)</li>
<li>Trade $5,000 and get $75 ($150 total)</li>
</ul>
<p>Reports indicate that you can do one ~$260 buy and then immediate sell ~$255 to get the entire $75 payout in one shot ($15+$20+$40). The buy and sell count separately, and so if you buy $260 and then sell $255 (you typically lose a few dollars in the process) it will be more than the required $500.</p>
<p>Someone who wants to do $5,000 in trades, can transfer over a smaller amount (e.g. $400 or $500) and then continue to buy/sell the same money until they meet the $5,000 threshold. Keep in mind there will be some loss with each sale, so you might not gain much with the $5,000 deal over the $500 deal unless you know what you are doing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Opt in to Kraken+ free trial for 30 days to save the 1% trade fees; just remember to cancel.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 8pt;">There are some other varieties of referral links. All referral links should work for the $75 bonus if you buy/sell $500 (e.g. $260 buy and then $255 sell). Most links also have the added $75 bonus when you buy/sell $5,000.</span></p>
<h2>The Fine Print</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.kraken.com/referrals">You need to trade actual crypto</a> to be eligible for the referral bonus whereas for the portal bonus you can trade stablecoin, far as I can tell.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Both the referral and the portal bonuses require the trade be done in the first 30 days.&nbsp;</li>
<li>The Kraken Referral Program is available only in the United States (excluding Maine, Washington and New York), Canada, Netherlands, France, Spain, Poland, Italy, Belgium, and Ireland.</li>
<li>(Editor&#8217;s note: A reader points out that presumably the shopping portal component should work even in the excluded states; just the referral bonus won&#8217;t work.)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Our Verdict</h2>
<p>If you click through Rakuten, apply a referral code during signup, and then trade $500 in crypto within 30 days, you&#8217;ll end up with 15,000/$150 from Rakuten and you&#8217;ll get $75 referral bonus from Kraken. You can trade an additional $4,500 in crypto to get the additional $75 bonus, if you choose.</p>
<p>Myself and others were able to get the portal to stack with a referral code by clicking through the portal and then entering a referral code. Within minutes you should get the email from Kraken about the referral bonus. I did the Bitcoin trade and then immediately sold the Bitcoin since I didn&#8217;t want money tied up in crypto and subject to those long risky fluctuations.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Note: even if you do Kraken+ for free trading, you can still lose some money as the crypto cost fluctuates in the few minutes between buy/sell. I bought Bitcoin and sold it a couple of minutes later and somehow lost $6 in the process. This was with a small purchase of Bitcoin that I bought. Some people report even more losses, especially when trading larger amounts. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">For that reason, many people will prefer the $75 referral bonus for an easy $150+$75 for a small $500 crypto buy. Do what you&#8217;re comfortable with.&nbsp;</span>Ideas for those who want to do the $5,000/$150 tier:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reportedly you can use the same funds to meet a tier. For example, you can transfer in $260 and then trade that twice to meet the $500 tier. Or you can transfer in $5000-$600 and trade it ten times (buy/sell) and meet the $5,000 tier.</li>
<li>You can set a Limit price to your buys and sells which can help reduce the losses in each sale.<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Again, those who are not adept at these methods might prefer to just do a simple $500 buy/sell (and probably lose a few dollars along the way) in order to get the portal bonus + $75 referral bonus, and ignore the second tier.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>After signing up with Kraken, you can also &#8216;Spin to win&#8217; once per day for the first 30 days, and you should end up with another $20-$30 from that. So that&#8217;s a little added bonus on top.</p>
<p>If you are new to Rakuten shoppping portal,<a href="https://www.doctorofcredit.com/rakuten-50-5000-referral-bonus-highest-ever/"> now is a good time to signup for the $50/5,000 signup bonus</a>. (<a href="https://www.doctorofcredit.com/get-100-10000-from-rakuten-or-topcashback-with-kraken-signup-stack-with-referral-bonus/#comment-2191119">There&#8217;s even a chance</a> that doing this Kraken offer will be enough to meet the spend requirement for that signup bonus.)</p>

<title>Amazon: Apple Watch Series 11 For $349/$379</title>
<link>https://www.doctorofcredit.com/amazon-apple-watch-series-11-for-349-379/</link>
<guid>https://www.doctorofcredit.com/amazon-apple-watch-series-11-for-349-379/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> 
Amazon 特价销售 2025 年 9 月新发布的 Apple Watch Series 11，42mm 型号售价 $349.99，46mm 型号售价 $379.99，均为原价的折扣价。目前仅 Amazon 有此低价，节日期间其他零售商可能会有类似优惠。 <div>
<h2>The Offer</h2>
<p>Amazon link to 42mm | Amazon link to 46mm &#8211; choose your color <em>(these contain our affiliate, thanks for your support)</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Amazon is selling the 42mm Apple Watch Series 11 for $349.99. Compare <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-watch/apple-watch">on Apple</a> for $399.</li>
<li>Amazon is selling the 46mm Apple Watch Series 11 for $379.99. Compare <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-watch/apple-watch">on Apple</a> for $429.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Our Verdict</h2>
<p>This is the model recently released in September 2025. Right now only Amazon has this low price, though I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised to see it on other retailers like Walmart and Best Buy at some point over the holidays. Stack <a href="https://www.doctorofcredit.com/complete-guide-saving-money-amazon-save-8-25/">with Shop With Points deals on Amazon for further discount.&nbsp;</a></p>

<title>(Update) ShopBack Shopping Portal $15+ In Signup Bonuses &amp; More; Earn Cashback On Amazon &amp; More</title>
<link>https://www.doctorofcredit.com/shopback-shopping-portal-20-signup-bonus-earn-cashback-on-amazon-ubereats-more/</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> 
ShopBack是提供现金返还的购物平台和浏览器扩展。新用户通过邀请码9f41g1注册可获$15奖励，另有$5扩展奖励和$6运费补贴。当前优惠包括Amazon购物返现、Walmart 20%返现、Doordash 10%返现等。用户可通过Quests任务获取额外奖励，如购物三品牌得$10。提现门槛为$5，通过PayPal进行。文章还列举了各种限时优惠，如ShipStation订阅返$45和Private Internet Access VPN 120%返现，以及历史优惠更新记录。 <div>
<p>Update 11/17/25:</p>
<ul>
<li>$45 back with paid ShipStation subscription. Shopback and Topcashback are both offering this. It seems to be a $30 moneymaker with a $15 subscription, but totally possible that I&#8217;m missing some details here.</li>
<li>120% back on Private Internet Access VPN (should be a $11 moneymaker; add-ons probably won’t track; there is a 30-day moneyback guarantee which is useful in case of a portal tracking issue)</li>
</ul>
<h2>ShopBack Highlights</h2>
<p><a href="https://app.shopback.com/hET2obekhSb">Direct Link to ShopBack</a><em> (this link contains my referral code)</em></p>
<p>ShopBack is a cashback portal and extension &#8211; click through the portal or the extension and earn cashback on purchases at hundreds of retailers.</p>
<p>Here a few interesting offers that I see right now; these offers will change over time. You should be able to <a href="https://www.shopback.com/key-campaign?component_uid=wRJ3tTjx8CEd84wEBHfKp2_20000002_20000697">see many of the current boosted deals at this link.</a></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Amazon</strong> (<a href="https://www.shopback.com/amazon-store">portal link</a>)- ShopBack is offering <del>$1 back for each and every purchase you make on Amazon</del> 1.5% cashback on Amazon purchases, up to $5 per order and up to 5 purchases each month. Maximize by only clicking Shopback on your large Amazon purchases. Note: The terms exclude purchases paid with your Amazon gift card balance. For the Amazon cashback you need to click through the extension, whereas for other retailers you can click through the online portal without the extension. ShopBack does insert their affiliate cookie on the Amazon purchase which will supersede any other affiliate you clicked from.</li>
<li><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><del><strong>Walmart</strong> (<a href="https://www.shopback.com/walmart">portal link</a>) &#8211; currently they are offering 20% back on Walmart purchases in select categories. Max $15 cashback.</del></span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><del><strong>Doordash</strong> (<a href="https://www.shopback.com/doordash">portal link</a>) &#8211; 10% back, up to $10 back on an order.</del></span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><del><strong>Uber EATS</strong> &#8211; earn $4 on each order (not limited to first order like on other portals).</del></span></li>
</ul>
<h2>Referral Bonus $15 &amp; More</h2>
<p><strong>ShopBack has a nice signup bonus of $15</strong> for new members who sign up using a referral link. The $15 will reflect immediately in your ShopBack. Within 180 days, the new member has to earn <del>$5</del> $10 in Confirmed Cashback. The $15 referral bonus will then become available if you&#8217;ve confirmed your Paypal withdrawal details.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">There&#8217;s also a $15 bonus for the referrer.</span>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.shopback.com/referral/invite">After signing up, you&#8217;ll be able to find your referral link on this page.</a></p>
<p>If you ever wanted to buy me a drink, <a href="https://app.shopback.com/hET2obekhSb">here is my ShopBack referral link</a>. Thanks. 🙂 <span style="font-size: 8pt;">(You&#8217;ll see the referral bonus reflected when clicking through the link. You can also go directly to Shopback.com and enter referral code <strong>9f41g1</strong> during signup and you&#8217;ll see the $15 signup bonus reflected on the page.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>$5 Extension Bonus</strong></span></p>
<p>They also typically have a special offer for new members to get $5 for adding the Shopback browser extension and using it once. These offers vary, but keep a lookup on your Quests.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>$6 Shipping Bonus</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">New users typically also have an offer to get $5.98 in bonuses via two $2.99 shipping rebates if you shop through the Shopback browser extension. You have to apply the rebate at checkout and then the cashback shows up in your account afterward. </span><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><a href="https://www.doctorofcredit.com/shopback-shopping-portal-20-signup-bonus-earn-cashback-on-amazon-ubereats-more/#comment-2058856">Some report</a> getting those shipping rebates even when there was no shipping cost. YMMV. </span><span style="font-size: 10pt;">New users should see this shipping rebate offer on their Quests page. </span><span style="font-size: 10pt;">It only works at select retailers (including Walmart, Best Buy, eBay, Petco, Temu, DoorDash, Newegg and more), and only when using the extension. Easyish $5.98 in bonuses.</span></p>
<h2>Quests Bonus</h2>
<p>You can also get various other bonuses on Shopback by going to the Quests tab at the top of the page, or <a href="https://www.shopback.com/quests">use this link.</a> <strong>Be sure to &#8216;Join&#8217; the Quests and then afterward &#8216;claim&#8217; the bonus.</strong> You might be doing some of these activities anyway and these are easy additional bonuses.</p>
<p>Here are some of the Quests bonuses, these bonuses will change over time; I&#8217;ll leave these here just as examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>$10 bonus for shopping any 3 brands</li>
<li>$20 on first purchase with a minimum spend of $10 or more</li>
<li>$20 for spending $250 on travel brands</li>
<li>For Ulta and Bed Bath &amp; Beyond: shop $100 and get $10 (that&#8217;s on top of the regular portal rates)</li>
</ul>
<p>Note: Quests are sometimes shown only to selected users, and they also have a quota which runs out; it can run out until you &#8216;Claim&#8217; it so do that as soon as you can. Click on each Quests offer separately to find additional details and terms of the offer.</p>
<h2>Cashout</h2>
<p>ShopBack offers Paypal to cashout. $5 minimum required to cashout.</p>

</ul>
<p>Older update history<a href="https://www.doctorofcredit.com/shopback-deal-history/"> can be found at this link.</a></p>
<h2>Our Verdict</h2>
<p>This looks to be an easy $15 with the initial signup referral bonus if you can get $5 in cashback earnings (e.g. five Amazon purchases or any other merchant). And hopefully you&#8217;ll get a few Quests bonuses or other increased offers which can spruce up your earnings further.</p>
<p>Other than the initial signup bonuses, the portal can be useful for the cashback earn on Amazon and for some of the other boosted cashback offers as well. Always compare rates against other shopping portals on <a href="https://www.cashbackmonitor.com/">Cashbackmonitor</a> or another aggregator.</p>
<p>ShopBack has<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ShopBack">&nbsp;a Wikipedia page</a> and has apparently been around since at least 2015. They seem to be an established company in other countries and are now expanding into the U.S. (We have no direct relationship with ShopBack.)</p>
<p>The Shopback platform has a sleek and professional feel. I also like that the terms are spelled out clearly for each retailer. Hopefully this will turn out to be another useful shopping portal/extension. Feel free to chime in below with your experiences.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> 
美国运通(AmEx)为Platinum和Business Gold卡持卡人提供Walmart促销：在Walmart.com或移动App消费满60美元可获20美元账单贷记(最高40美元)，有效期至2025年12月31日；25%折扣(最高25返利)，有效期至2026年1月31日。优惠仅限在线购买，不包括Walmart+会员费、批量礼品卡、店内购买、第三方网站交易及美国境外运输的购买。仅限美元直接交易，不适用于第三方的Walmart.com关联网站。 <div>
<h2>The Offer</h2>
<p>Check your AmEx Offers on the American Express consumer Platinum and Business Gold cards for one of the following deals:</p>
<ul>
<li>Earn a $20 statement credit after using your enrolled eligible to spend a minimum of $60 in one or more purchases online at Walmart.com or the Walmart mobile app by 12/31/2025. Limit of 2 statement credits (total of $40).&nbsp;</li>
<li>Get 25% off Walmart.com, valid through 1/31/26. Max $25 back.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<h2>The Fine Print</h2>
<ul>
<li>Offer valid online only at US website Walmart.com or through the Walmart mobile app. Valid on Walmart pickup and delivery purchases made online at Walmart.com.</li>
<li>Excludes Walmart+ membership purchases.</li>
<li>Not valid on purchases shipped outside of the US. Excludes in-store purchases, bulk gift cards and e-gift cards, layaway purchases, insurance services, auto services, pharmacy, protection plans, home services, and recurring subscription services (for example, Beauty Box and Baby Box).</li>

<li>Offer valid only on purchases made in US dollars.</li>
<li>Offer only valid on purchases made directly with the merchant.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<h2>Our Verdict</h2>
<p>This is a special offer for the consumer Platinum card and the Business Gold card. It might be available to all those who have these cards. Obviously a great deal for Walmart.</p>
<p>Offers excludes bulk gift card purchases, <a href="https://www.doctorofcredit.com/amex-offer-deals-work-purchase-gift-cards/">and it should work fine on ordinary gift cards</a> purchased on Walmart.com or the Walmart mobile app (whether Walmart&#8217;s own gift cards or a third party gift card) since these would process through the regular Walmart.com checkout system. Useful to then use the Walmart gift card to shop in store or at Sam&#8217;s Club or at their gas stations.</p>
