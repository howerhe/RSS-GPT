<div><p><img class="header" height="226" src="https://cdn3.brettterpstra.com/uploads/2025/10/bearandglass-header-rb.7501.jpg" style="margin: 0 auto; clear: both;" width="800" /></p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve mentioned before that what I really wanted out of my career was to be a consultant, especially in automation and efficiency on Mac and iOS, for teams and small-to-medium size businesses looking to grow. Well, I&rsquo;m excited to have teamed up with Christopher Gamblée-Wallendjack to create <a href="https://bearandglass.co">Bear &amp; Glass</a>.</p>

<p>We want to take what we normally do for individuals one-on-one and bring it to teams. I&rsquo;m excited to be launching this!</p>

<p>Bear &amp; Glass will make the work I do and the things I create accessible to people that might never have found me on their own &mdash; creative teams who need someone who speaks both human and machine. When one person decides what &ldquo;clever&rdquo; tool the whole company will use, it rarely works. If the needs of the people actually using the tools aren&rsquo;t heard, they won&rsquo;t use them &mdash; and everyone&rsquo;s right back where they started. That&rsquo;s why Bear &amp; Glass will talk to everyone. We build systems and automations that make sense to the people who rely on them, and which connect perfectly to create the whole.</p>

<p>The automation possibilities are vast. We can do everything from
speeding up your email workflow to streamlining your publishing,
onboarding, and day-to-day operations. We provide stable, future-proof
automations that scale with your business. We specialize in Mac and iOS
automation, but we also do Unix automations and server-side operations.</p>

<p>Working with Christopher is the perfect pairing: I get to focus on the automation side, and Christopher, who specializes in customer service, documentation, and project management, gets to focus on the people.</p>

<p>So if you&rsquo;re someone who believes their team or business could be saving time, working more efficiently, or improving everything from onboarding to operations with our bespoke services, visit <a href="https://bearandglass.co">bearandglass.co</a> and contact us today! You&rsquo;ll get a personal response from Christopher, who can answer all of you questions!</p>

<h3><a href="https://brett.trpstra.net/link/535/17199025/one-more-na-update">One more na update</a></h3>
<div><p>This week I pushed a set of focused improvements to <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/projects/na">NA</a> that make interactive workflows a lot smoother and the codebase a little more robust — including first‑class time tracking.</p>

<p>If you run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">na update</code> without arguments you&rsquo;ll now get an interactive menu that helps you pick the file(s) and actions to operate on, and I&rsquo;ve added a flexible plugin architecture and time tracking features.</p>

<h2 id="tldr">TL;DR</h2>

<ul>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">na update</code> (no args) now launches an interactive, consistent selection flow for files and actions.</li>
  <li>The update submenu supports multi-select, edit, move, and direct action ...</div>

<div><p>I&rsquo;ve been putting in some time on side projects every morning while building up the motivation to work on more overwhelming things. Recently the focus was on <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/projects/reiki">Reiki</a>, my tool for running Rake tasks with fuzzy matching and humane argument parsing.</p>

<div><p>I&rsquo;ve been using my <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/projects/na/">na</a> and <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/projects/doing/">doing</a> command-line tools daily for years, but lately they&rsquo;d started feeling sluggish. When <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">na next</code> was taking over a second to show me my next actions from a tiny 5KB file, I knew it was time to dig in and fix things.</p>

<p>In case you&rsquo;re unfamiliar, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">na</code> is a command line tool for adding and listing per-project todos, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">doing</code> is a CLI for tracking what you were doing, with export features, time tracking, tagging, and other usefuly features.</p>

<p>This is just a little 30-minute project I made for my own use, but figured I&rsquo;d share. It simply takes a YouTube URL and converts it to GitHub-friendly Markdown for use in READMEs, wikis, and PR comments.</p>

<p>GitHub doesn&rsquo;t allow for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;iframe&gt;</code>s, so you can&rsquo;t actually embed a YouTube video in a README. You can, however, easily embed a thumbnail and link it to the video. This little API does just that. Sure, it&rsquo;s built with GitHub in mind, but it&rsquo;s useful in any situation where you can&rsquo;t use an actual embed but...</div>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been playing around with progress bars in the terminal, and I think I&rsquo;ve
created something genuinely useful.</p>

<p>Yes, I know there are multiple options
already available for this, this is mostly just an experiment for me. I wanted to build a Ruby library that
could be used for command-line scripting, with CLI executables that made it easy
to use when scripting in <em>any</em> language &mdash; not just Ruby, with a few
options I didn&rsquo;t see elsewhere.</p>

<p>The result is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ruby-progress</code>, a gem that provides four different animated...</div>

<p>I&rsquo;ve published a tiny Jekyll plugin that makes terminal commands in posts runnable with a click (in iTerm, at least).</p>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/ttscoff/JekyllPlugins/tree/master/iTerm">iTerm tag plugin</a> renders a fenced code block showing a command, and a &ldquo;Run in iTerm&rdquo; link that uses iTerm 2&rsquo;s new(ish) command url scheme (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">iterm2:/command?c=COMMAND</code>) to open the command in a confirmation box in iTerm, ready for immediate execution.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve built a paywall system for this blog. It was quite an endeavor to make a home-grown solution that works with my static Jekyll site, but I think I got it.</p>

<p>From now on, I&rsquo;ll be adding bonus content to posts that will only available to subscribers. You can subscribe at any level &mdash; the benefits are the same whether you pay $3, $6, or $12 per month. You can subscribe using PayPal, with or without a PayPal account.

<p>A few times over the last couple of years I&rsquo;ve wanted to do an open poll to get a feel for how users felt about things, particularly icons during the design process. I found there aren&rsquo;t a lot of affordable ways to do this.</p>

<p>What I wanted was a way to upload multiple images and get <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranked_voting">ranked-choice voting</a> on them. If you&rsquo;re not familiar, ranked voting is a system where voters rank their choices in order of preference, and then an algorithm is used to determine the winner.

<p>In Cursor, when it&rsquo;s generating or thinking, it shows some text that looks like a spotlight is panning across it. I figured it would be easy enough to replicate, so I did.</p>

<div><p>Thanks to SaneBox for sponsoring BrettTerpstra.com this week! Rather than the typical sponsored post, I&rsquo;ve opened up the blog to a guest post from SaneBox&rsquo;s Thomas Yuan. Not a typical thing for me, but I&rsquo;m a huge fan of SaneBox and Thomas&rsquo; tools are a perfect fit for my readers (and my own preferences). Please enjoy!</p>

<p>Picture this: There&rsquo;s a constant stream of messages filling your inbox, from notifications to urgent memos to mailing lists you joined 10 years ago.

<p>You&rsquo;re probably familiar with Spotlight, but there are other ways to find files on your Mac. And some of them don&rsquo;t get enough love.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve tried all of these, and I like them all for different reasons. I&rsquo;m generally happy with HoudahSpot when Spotlight fails me, but I wanted to point these out because they fit specific use-cases &mdash; maybe ones you run into often enough to try them out.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been playing around with a free app called <a href="https://github.com/mikker/LeaderKey.app">Leader Key</a> from <a href="https://mastodon.social/@mikker">@mikker</a>, and realized it could be used very effectively with <a href="https://bunchapp.co">Bunch</a>. It takes a little manual setup, but it&rsquo;s not hard.</p>

<p>Leader Key is an interesting launcher app that lets you assign single letter keystrokes to launch apps, urls, run commands, or open folders. Yes, all of this can be done fairly easily with Alfred or LaunchBar, but I really like the single-key approach. Once you develop muscle memory for an...</div>

<p>After 4 years with Oracle, I find myself free for new work.
I met a lot of good people there, but am excited about the

but optimistic for the long term.</p>

<p>Hookmark just added Linkding integration, and I&rsquo;m really excited about it. It&rsquo;s a perfect complement to the local bookmarking that Hookmark makes possible.</p>

<p>I love <a href="https://hookproductivity.com/">Hookmark</a>, and it&rsquo;s getting easier to explain as it develops. With Hookmark, you can connect any objects on your Mac to each other, from todo items to documents to notes to web pages.
