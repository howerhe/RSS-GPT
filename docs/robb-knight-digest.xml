<h3><a href="https://rknight.me/blog/weeknote-1973/">Weeknote #1973</a></h3>
<div><p>It's been a while since <a href="https://rknight.me/blog/weeknote-1966/">my last weeknote</a> and it's fine - this is why I'm not committing to doing them weekly.</p>
<p>We are hurtling towards the end of the year and I realised I haven't been taking notes for my <a href="https://rknight.me/blog/tags/yearinreview/">year in review</a> post so I've hastily thrown some notes together but I'm sure I will miss something important when I eventually write it.</p>
<p>I don't have McDonald's all that often but I tried the garlic &amp; black pepper nuggets last week - they were pretty good. I also had the Sakura Cherry Blossom × Sprite which was delicious.</p>

<h3><a href="https://rknight.me/blog/inktober-completed-it-mate/">Inktober? Completed It Mate</a></h3>
<div><p>After my adventures with <a href="https://rknight.me/blog/get-okay/">getting okay at drawing</a> I decided to have a go at participating in <a href="https://inktober.com">Inktober</a> - one drawing every day for 31 days based on a prompt, the full list of which you can <a href="https://inktober.com/rules">see here</a>.</p>
<p>I did the first two prompts (mustache and weave) and then on the third day I stumbled upon a dinosaur character I quite liked, who I have named Jeff. He appeared in the next few drawings so I went back and redid them to feature Jeff. I love Jeff.</p>
<p>I love all my inky children equally but these are some of my favourites. I find it notable these are all after the halfway point of the month.</p>

<p>We caught up on what I've been up to since <a href="https://www.relay.fm/penaddict/657">the last time I was on</a> in March, how pens led me indirectly into <a href="https://rknight.me/blog/get-okay/">drawing for St Jude</a> and then <a href="https://rknight.me/blog/tags/inktober2025/">Inktober</a>.

<div><p>I <a href="https://rknight.me/blog/pilot-juice-planet-labyrinth-set/">posted in July</a> about the Pilot Juice Planet Labyrinth set which are neon editions of the juice line. I had mentioned there was a second set called Space Smash and I picked those up this week.</p>
<figure><img alt="Three pens next to writing samples in yellow, blue, purple. Other samples are orange, pink, and green. The yellow is very hard to read" src="https://cdn.rknight.me/site/2025/pilot-juice-space-smash.jpg" /></figure>
<p>The purple is great, blue is decent, but the yellow is nearly impossible to read - I thought the green was bad but yellow is much worse for readability.</p>...</div>

<div><p>Of all the things parents can annoy you with the clichés are the worst. &quot;You won't know until you try&quot;. Okay mum, whatever you say. I think you know where this is going.</p>
<p>I've always thought I wasn't any good at drawing but what had actually happened is I never tried. Like really, sat down with a pencil and paper and tried to draw something. Maybe with a reference image. It turns out, if you actually try a little bit you might be okay at a thing.</p>
<p>Near the start of the St Jude campaign I noticed I had some spare stamps so I figured why not use them on something interesting like...do a drawing and I'll send it to someone. Initially I intended them to be my usual &quot;I haven't tried that hard&quot; ones but then people actually donated for one and I panicked. <em>I...</div>

<div><p>It's the 2nd of October, AKA <a href="https://isitseptember.fyi/">Bonus September</a> which means Relay's St Jude campaign is more-or-less over, having blown past the $700k target. Adam and I fell short of our target but still <a href="https://tiltify.com/@rknightuk/stjude2025">raised over $15k</a>, putting us just shy of $49k raised over the past three years.</p>
<p>As we tend to do, we added additional stickers during the campaign. Everyone who donated for stickers is getting five stickers instead of the original two which are being ordered and posted very soon.</p>

<div><p>It's <a href="https://isitseptember.fyi/">nearly effectively September</a>, everything is ready and standing by for the start of Relay's annual podcastathon and fundraising event. We have some excellent stickers this year.</p>
<p>I'm not one for music videos unless it's OK Go but Apple Music on my TV kept showing me a preview of the video for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4DVbm9zeR0">Cliche by mgk</a> so I gave it a watch. Not only is the song a banger, the video is just so good. I can't pinpoint what it is but I love it. mgk seems like a complete ding dong of a person but he is stupidly talented.</p>

<p>I've been wanting to get a <a href="https://www.campsnapphoto.com">Camp Snap camera</a> for a while but they're kind of pricey for what they are so I'd been holding off.

<div><p>I'm at the end of my first journal and starting a new one on Friday. I've learnt some lessons about what does and doesn't work for me, spent some time setting up some collections for ideas to keep track of those and of course I <a href="https://rknight.me/notes/202507292100/">setup the mildliner sample pages again</a>. I'm also excited to use my yellow EF TWSBI Eco which doesn't write nicely in my current journal.</p>
<p>I picked up a slide for Baby Knight which just <em>barely</em> fit in my car and made the drive back pretty precarious but she bloody loves it so it's all worth it.</p>

<p>I've played a good ten or so hours with the new Tony Hawk game and it does more or less what was promised, and what I expected. The game plays just like the 1+2 remaster, no surprises there.</p>
<p>Bam is back 🥳.</p>
<p>I'm surprised how little of the original soundtrack made it to this version but the most of the new tracks are very good. I made a <a href="https://music.apple.com/gb/playlist/tony-hawk-pro-skater-3-4-remaster/pl.u-WR7GIdBJpqv">playlist on Apple Music</a>.</p>

<h3><a href="https://rknight.me/blog/knightprints-first-run/">KnightPrint's First Run</a></h3>
<div><p>Last week my wife and I bought what is commonly known as a Cat Printer: it's a very cheap (&lt; £10) thermal printer that has a cat face on it. The official way of using it is with one of many terrible apps - each company who sells these tweaks the models a bit and has their own app but I was interested to see that some folks have reversed engineered the printers to print from various places including my favourite, the web. And I knew exactly what I wanted to do with it: let people toot me and it get printed.</p>

<div><p>Hot innit. Too fucking hot.</p>
<p>Wednesday night we went up <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portsdown_Hill">Portsdown Hill</a> with the kids for dinner because we couldn't be bothered to cook so we got burgers from <a href="https://www.facebook.com/p/Micks-Monster-Burgers-100057133133661/?locale=en_GB">Mick's</a>. It also gave Baby Knight the First somewhere to run around like a lunatic to burn off some energy. It didn't work but she did have fun.</p>
<p>My wife wanted an instant printer to print some photos of the kids for her journal and it was Prime Day so we had a look around. I'd decided, as CTO of our house, that the <a href="https://kodakphotoprinter.com/products/best-photo-printer-kodak-mini-3-retro">Kodak P300R</a> was perfect for what we wanted but then I noticed for ...</div>

<p>This is a set of 0.5mm Pilot Juice pens in neon pink, green, and orange. &quot;Planet Labyrinth&quot; is the set name - theres also a set available called &quot;<a href="https://stationerypal.com/products/pilot-juice-space-smash-limited-edition-gel-pen-neon-color-set-of-3">Space Smash</a>&quot;. The pink is <em>gorgeous</em> and the orange is wonderfully vibrant. The green is pretty disappointing though and hard to see at some angles (like my photo above). Here's a close up so you can see what it does look like. I think a 0.7mm tip might have been better for the green.</p>

<p>Go to your hosting provider’s website, log in, and enter the token in the appropriate claim field.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sounds easy enough if you use one of the twenty or so hosting providers that Apple say support this but what if you have a moment of clarity and realise <em>you are the hosting provider</em>. What are the hosting providers putting in the RSS feed to validate the claim? Because I couldn't find an Apple support document that explains it, although I'm sure it exists.</p>

<p>I got 63 orders in total for <a href="https://rknight.me/blog/dont-at-me-stickers/">the stickers</a> (plus two duplicates I refunded), 13 in the UK and 50 international.

<div><p>I was listening to <a href="https://www.relay.fm/connected/556">the results of the Rickies</a> a couple of days ago and realised it was a perfect candidate for a plugin for my <a href="https://usetrmnl.com/">TRMNL</a>.</p>
<p>Both <a href="https://rickies.net/">Rickipedia</a> and <a href="https://rickies.co">The Rickies</a> have API endpoints to check these things — I ended up using Rickipedia as it had more info available to do what I needed.</p>
<figure><img alt="The Rickies winner on a TRMNL screen" src="https://cdn.rknight.me/site/2025/trmnl-rickies.jpg" /></figure>
<p>The plugin handles the scenario like now where we have a benchman as well as if there are separate keynote and annual chairmen. I spent some time working out the percentages so I can place the winner &quot;magnets&quo...</div>

<div><p>Yesterday I <a href="https://rknight.me/notes/202506171340/">asked</a> if anyone knew of an iOS podcast app that also had a self-hostable backend or one with a sanctioned API. I have two requirements I'm interested in:</p>
<ol>
<li>A decent podcast experience. This is the &quot;easy&quot; bit. I want to subscribe, download new episodes, and listen to them.</li>
<li>An API to access my listening history. I'm doing this in a horrible way right now with Overcast, I would much prefer a proper API.</li>
</ol>
<p>I got multiple suggestions which came down to two options: <a href="https://www.plex.tv">Plex</a> with <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/id1459223267">Prologue</a> and <a href="https://www.audiobookshelf.org">audiobookshelf</a> with either <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/she...</div>

<p>I'm a cat dad to a cat called Morpheus and a human dad to two girls. I'm a developer in my day job but I also work on my own projects and freelance outside of that and I also podcast.</p>

<div><p>I got a new MacBook a couple of weeks ago but since I've had it I've not been able to use Tesco's website to do my shopping but I'd just ignored it and used my work machine. Then tonight I couldn't upload <a href="https://ruminatepodcast.com/209/">the latest episode of Ruminate</a> to Libsyn so I had to investigate.</p>
<p><code>ERR_SSL_BAD_RECORD_MAC_ALERT</code> was the error I was seeing in the console on both sites. There was lot of suggestions of resetting the Mac, re-adding the wifi, I rebooted my network, but none of it worked. Then the last comment of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MacOS/comments/1cmz6jl/err_ssl_bad_record_mac_alert/">this Reddit thread</a> said &quot;<em>I discovered that I had to set the MTU of the Macbook (not the router!) to 1280 and I no longer have the ...</div>

<p>On Sunday, the folks who run <a href="https://hackpompey.co.uk">Hack Pompey</a> hosted a new event at the offices of <a href="https://wafflegame.net/daily">Waffle</a> they're calling Hack Club:</p>

<p>This pilot event was invite-only and Ryan was kind enough to invite me so I went along.

<h3><a href="https://rknight.me/blog/new-logo-who-dis/">New Logo, Who Dis?</a></h3>
<div><p>Last week <a href="https://social.lol/@humdrum#.">Kevin</a> posted about running <a href="https://foofaraw.press/sponsorship/">sponsorships on Foofaraw</a> and I figured it would be a nice, small-scale experiment with running ads for <a href="https://echofeed.app">EchoFeed</a> so I bought three slots. The problem was I <em>hated</em> the EchoFeed logo and have done since the site launched. It does the job but it was put together last minute and I didn't have any better ideas at the time:</p>
<figure><img alt="The original EchoFeed logo with a soundwave in the middle and two white squares around it" src="https://cdn.rknight.me/site/2025/echofeed-logo-original.jpg" /></figure>

<p>I got it for £25 which quite frankly seems like a bargain given the rarity of it — if it wasn't so ugly, I suspect this would sell for a lot more. It didn't come with the original ink cartridge it was sold with (it's 25 years old so that's reasonable) so I grabbed <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B000WKM50G">a converter on Amazon</a> and filled it with <a href="https://mountainofin...</div>
